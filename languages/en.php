In the beginning, I changed my diet slowly and carefully, I have adapted it to my existing gym movement to have minimal or zero muscle loss, which is hard to avoid when losing weight. On the first picture, I could be around 130 kilos with over 30% body fat. On the second picture, however, I am standing proud in front of the camera at 80 kilos, with less than 10% body fat. Since I managed to lose weight - and of course I have been holding this 80 kilo weight for over a year now and I am still eating clean, consciously, healthy - I have increased my confidence, have a lot more energy, and I am feeling much better overall. Of course, it wasn't easy to change your lifestyle in the beginning, but if you have the dedication, perseverance, and motivation you can do everything you set up your mind to do."
